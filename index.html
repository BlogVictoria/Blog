                    Australia, I want to visit New-York. I am from Ukraine and I love going there! It is very fun!

                            enjoyed! <br><br>I stayed in a hotel 10 minutes away from the beach. Every day I went there
                            with my family, and in the evening I went in the city. Most of the day I was there, exept
                            when I went for lunch. But once, we ordered pizza to the beach! <br><br> I am so exited
                            because I will go to Greece again this year! </p>

                            my first Easter in London. I really loved it and I would really recomend you to visit it.

                        <p>I went to see Hapton Court twice. It was once a home to one of the first Tudor rulers - Henry
                            the 8th, and his relatives. Now it is a musiem which shows what was life like during the
                            Tudor times. Henry was a very wealthy person who had 2 chocolate factories, a giant master
                            bedroom and a enormous dining hall. Most of the things now are replicas, but some are real.

                        <p>I had a school race last year. It was very fun! I came almost at the very end, but I still
                            had lots of fun doing it! </p>

                        <p>I did a play called "Beauty and the Beast." I was REALLY scared at first, but as soon as we
                            did it, it was sooo fun! </p>

                            have 4 badges. </p>

                        <p>I can't think of any other achivments,but my first day of school was an achivment for me.
                            Like ny first play, I was really scared at first. But then I realised that school is very
                            fun and there is nothing to be afraid of! </p>
